<h1>WELCOME TO THE POINEER BATCH OF Vi-2S-Dk FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT CLASS</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  The poineer batch of the Vi-2s-Dk front end web development class started on the 2nd day of November 2019 with predominantly students from the south of the Mungo.
  The class started with an attendance rate of 9 students and currently the active population has droped down to 5. The field of web development is a very lucrative one and there is hope that all the remaining five active students will get something going. However, it will certainly boil down to personal engagements.
